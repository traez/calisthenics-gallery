# Florin Pop's App Ideas Collection - React Router Gallery Project

This is a (modified) solution to [React Router Gallery Project of Florin Pop's App Ideas Collection](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Recipe-App.md). Florin Pop is a Developer and Content Creator, who loves to build In Public while motivating and encouraging others to follow their dreams. I'm trying to improve my coding skills by building realistic React Projects through his list.

## Overview

### The Challenge/User Stories
  
- The objective of this project was to build a recipe app ...possible using React Router.
- A different (hobby dedicated) app was instead built, but still sticking with React Router.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- React.js

### What I learned

- So I've deployed yet another project to Github. But this time it's a fully fledged multi-page website, ...created using React Router. Nothing fancy though, just effort birthed out of desire to scale a learning curve. The site's not even optimized for mobile (please view only using a desktop). Could even have been done with this in less than half the tim; because the data gathering was tres time consuming. But subject matter is my current lifestyle, so it's a labour of love anyway.  

### Continued development

- Going forward will build a couple more React projects. Amongst which should be something incorporating authentication. Will take time out to understand Git pull requests. And then probably be confident of abilities enough to start applying for internships/Junior Dev positions. Of course, the up-skilling never ends.
