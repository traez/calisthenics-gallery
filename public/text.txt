This project ended up being a mash up of 2 previous React Router projects. Both functionalities were combined aside fetch API call, and implemented via Next.js App router.
Different difficult bugs popped up along project life cycle, that they were all satisfactorily resolved. Practice will always make perfect and I look forward to doing similar projects in an advanced manner.
