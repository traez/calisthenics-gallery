## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

- This project ended up being a mash up of 2 previous React Router projects. Both functionalities were combined aside fetch API call, and implemented via Next.js App router.  
- Different difficult bugs popped up along project life cycle, that they were all satisfactorily resolved. Practice will always make perfect and I look forward to doing similar projects in an advanced manner.  

### Continued development

- More Next.js Apps, GraphQL, Technical Writing, Contributing to Open Source
