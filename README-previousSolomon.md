## Overview

### The challenge

Instructions:

- 1. Create a React app that loads images of cats. There are 2 pages: Homepage and Single
Cat Page.
- 2. The homepage has a select input box where you can choose a breed of cats. Selecting
a breed should load images of cats from the API listed under the corresponding breed.
Clicking on the "Load more" button should display more images that haven't been loaded
yet. Once the images already reach the end of the list, the "Load more" button should
disappear. Selecting a different breed should clear the previous images of cats and
display a new list of images.
- 3. Clicking on "View details" under each image should redirect to the Single Cat Page. The
Single Cat Page should display the following data: image, breed name, origin,
temperament, and description. Clicking "Back" at the top of the Single Cat Page should
go back to the homepage with the current breed already selected, therefore, the
Homepage should immediately load images of cats under the previously selected breed.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Router  

### What I learned

- This project has been the most stressful for a while. Took a couple of days wrapping my head around new React Router hooks which I used for the first time: useParams, useLocation, useNavigate. But in the end I'm grateful for the learning. 
- Got a new appreciation for technical writers. They are massive with documentation, tutorials and education. Will personally strive to do my bit to the ecosystem by documenting as much as possible.

### Continued development

User Login app using Auth0, Firebase database app, and then Next.js
